# fish

A user friendly command line shell . Read more about it [here](https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/awesome-ubuntu/#customising-terminal) for some resources.

Go to github > bobthefish and install nerdy fonts.

I've recently updated my [Notifyre](https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre)
project to support fish functionality. I use it for all commands, but may use it
for specific functions as well. You can see a demo image [here](thumbnail_fish.png)

`fisherman` folder placed here

The default location is ` ~/.config/fish/config.fish`

### Functions -

* `bandkar` - sudo shutdown now
* `waapas` - sudo reboot [Although sudo not needed ]
* `ga` - git add
* `gc` - git commit [gc -m "Message"]
* `gst` - git status
* `plsfind` - find for a file in recently modified - ex : `plsfind 1000 funcads` searches for funcads in last 1000 modified files
* `nf` - Notifies how much time a process took, and in which dir it is being used.
* `unlock` - remove lock that blocks update, install, upgrade

**Note** : fish has 1-based indexing, see *functions/plsfind.fish* as an example.
