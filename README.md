# dotfiles
Because dotfiles were getting quite a handful to manage.

All .config files needed for UI.

* Themes and all can be known from `screenshot.png`
* lock screen image - `elementary.jpg`
* profile picture -`git_pro_matrix.jpg`
* xfce window icon - `ubuntu_flat.png`

 Preferably keep these files in some location like - `/usr/share/backgrounds` or `/usr/share/icons`

* Docky is :heart:

 Add show desktop, remove docky icon. Settings still accessible from split in window.

* Terminal theme loosely based on solarised dark -

 Foreground text - `#ACE6ED`
 Background - `#020F12`

* No reason to use anything apart from xfce desktop. Low on resources, consumes upto 700 MB RAM on start, against 1.1 GB in Unity.

 Install xfce desktop -

 `sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop`

 `sudo apt-get install xfce4-goodies`
